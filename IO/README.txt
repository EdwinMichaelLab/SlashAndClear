This directory will contain all of the user edited variables for Baseline - 
Fitting, Breakpoint Calculations, and Interventions along with all inputs and
outputs for the aforementioned scripts. 

Workflow:

Open the file setup_Vars.m within an editor and change the values for the data
items which need to be changed. All scripts will seek this directory for the
output of the step before the script if necessary.

Upon changing runs for a different site or other reason, setup_Vars.m will need
to be edited again for the new or different site. The IN and OUT directories
could be cleaned, or simply overwritten. If using different sites, the previous
sites within OUT/ will not be overwritten, just simply not used. The IN/ dir
will be overwritten however.

Run the file setup_Vars.m, this will create input files for each of the 
processes: BaslineFitting, Breakpoint Calculations, and Interventions.
    matlab -nodisplay -nosplash < setup_Vars.m

    Files Created:
        Baseline_IN.mat, Break_IN.mat, Inter_IN.mat

Directory Structure:
    IO/
        setup_Vars.m
        IN/
            Baseline_IN.mat
            Break_IN.mat
            Inter_IN.mat
        OUT/
            ParamVectors%s.mat
            Mf_L3_bptsData%s_v3.mat
            Intv%s.mat
            (where %s is replaced and generated by the running script for sites.)

IN :
    All files are created by setup_Vars.m These should not be edited by a user
    nor should they be directly handled or moved. BaselineFitting, Breakpoint 
    and Interventions will all look to this folder to grab these inputs.

OUT :
    All files within OUT/ are created by running the Main procedure for each of
    the three different scripts: BaselineFitting, BreakpointCalc, and Interventions.
    These files are then, if necessary, grabbed by the next step of the overall process.
    In this way, the OUT/ directory is both an input and an output directory.
    This directory should not be directly edited by a user.
